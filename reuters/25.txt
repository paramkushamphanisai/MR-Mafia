Venezuela and its bank advisorycommittee have agreed in principle on revisions to the terms ofa 21 billion dlr debt-rescheduling package signed lastFebruary, bankers said.    They declined to disclose details because two or threerepresentatives on the panel have still to obtain the approvalof their senior management for the new terms.    The committee was meeting in New York this afternoon andcould put its final stamp of approval of the deal later today,the bankers said.    "A number of details have still to be finalized, but thebroad details of the new amortization schedules and interestrates are in place," one senior banker said.    The interest rate on the rescheduling was originally set at1-1/8 pct over Eurodollar rates, but Venezuela requested easierterms because of a 40 pct drop in oil income last year.    It also asked for a reduction in the repayments it was dueto make in 1987, 1988 and 1989 - after an earlier request thatit make no amortizations at all in those years was rebuffed -and sought a commitment from the banks to finance newinvestment in Venezuela.    The breakthrough in the Venezuelan talks, which have beengoing on intermittently for several months, follows theannouncement earlier today of a 10.6 billion dlr debtrescheduling pact between Chile and its bank advisory panel.    And last night Citibank said Mexico's financing package,including a 7.7 billion dlr loan, will be signed on March 20.    While the sudden progress is to some extent coincidental,bankers acknowledge a desire to chalk up some quick successesafter the shock of Brazil's unilateral interest suspension lastFriday. By striking swift deals, banks hope to reduce theincentive for other debtors to emulate Brazil. Reuter&#3;
