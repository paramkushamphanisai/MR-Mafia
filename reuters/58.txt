The chairmen and senior Republicanmembers of the House and Senate tax writing committees proposedlegislation to curb estate tax deduction on sales of stock toan employee stock ownership plan.    The proposal would raise federal revenues of 6.7 billiondlrs over the fiscal year period 1987 to 1991.    If adopted by Congress it would effect all transactionsafter Sept 26, 1987.    The plan was proposed by House Ways and Means CommitteeChairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill), Rep John Duncan (R-Tenn),Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex) and SenBob Packwood (R-Ore).    In a statement Rostenkowski said the estate tax deductionenacted last year as part of the tax reform bill was too broadand would have cost the governmet seven billion dlrs over fouryears. The narrower deduction would cost the government lessthan 300 mln dlrs for the same years.    He said it was designed to avoid sham transactions whichallowed estates to avoid taxes by transferring stock to ESOPs.    Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said in astatement, "The Tax Reform Act contains a provision that allowsmany wealthy individuals to avoid the federal estate taxentirely when they die."    He added, "The provision was intended to encourage estatesto sell stock to employee stock ownership plans as a way ofpromoting worker ownership; however, the provision was notmeant to be broad enough to reduce federal revenues as much asis currently estimated."    He added, "The bill I have introduced today calls for themodification of the provision in accordance with its intendedpurpose." Reuter&#3;
