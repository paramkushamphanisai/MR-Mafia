Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) andDaniel Evans (R-Wash.) said they introduced export licensingreform legislation that could save U.S. companies hundreds ofthousands of dollars annually.    "Our emphasis is two-fold: Decontrol and de-license itemswhere such actions will not endanger our national security, andeliminate the Department of Defense's de facto veto authorityover the licensing process," Cranston said.    "Our reforms should reduce licensing requirements by 65  to70 pct," he told reporters. "I am convinced that a morerational...licensing process will boost exports."    U.S. export controls are intended to deny Eastern bloccountries access to technology that could further theirmilitary capabilities.    "By refocusing our control resources on higher levels oftechnology, technology that is truly critical, we will do abetter job of preventing diversion of critical technology toour adversaries while promoting more exports," Cranston said.    "We cannot expect to continue to play a leading role in newtechnology development in the future if we unduly restrict theactivities of U.S. firms in the world market-place," Evans toldreporters.
