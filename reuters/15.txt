BankAmerica Corp is not underpressure to act quickly on its proposed equity offering andwould do well to delay it because of the stock's recent poorperformance, banking analysts said.    Some analysts said they have recommended BankAmerica delayits up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to beapproved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.    BankAmerica stock fell this week, along with other bankingissues, on the news that Brazil has suspended interest paymentson a large portion of its foreign debt.    The stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon,after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news.    Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of theFirst Interstate Bancorp &lt;I> takeover bid gone, BankAmerica isunder no pressure to sell the securities into a market thatwill be nervous on bank stocks in the near term.    BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen asone of the major factors leading the First Interstatewithdrawing its takeover bid on February 9.    A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longerthan expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.    "The circumstances at the time will determine what we do,"said Arthur Miller, BankAmerica's Vice President for FinancialCommunications, when asked if BankAmerica would proceed withthe offer immediately after it receives SEC approval.    "I'd put it off as long as they conceivably could," saidLawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner andSmith.    Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer theyhave to show the market an improved financial outlook.    Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types ofequities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertiblepreferred stock would encompass at least part of it.    Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean alower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stockholders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group.    Several analysts said that while they believe the Braziliandebt problem will continue to hang over the banking industrythrough the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely toease over the coming weeks.    Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.70 billiondlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if theinterest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mlndlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said JosephArsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co.    He noted, however, that any potential losses would not showup in the current quarter.    With other major banks standing to lose even more thanBankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt, the analystssaid they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to wayMexico's debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks.
