Sales of previously owned homesdropped 14.5 pct in January to a seasonally adjusted annualrate of 3.47 mln units, the National Association of Realtors(NAR) said.    But the December rate of 4.06 mln units had been thehighest since the record 4.15 mln unit sales rate set inNovember 1978, the group said.    "The drop in January is not surprising considering that asignificant portion of December's near-record pace was made upof sellers seeking to get favorable capital gains treatmentunder the old tax laws," said the NAR's John Tuccillo.
