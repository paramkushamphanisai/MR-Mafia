Ohio Mattress Co said its firstquarter, ending February 28, profits may be below the 2.4 mlndlrs, or 15 cts a share, earned in the first quarter of fiscal1986.    The company said any decline would be due to expensesrelated to the acquisitions in the middle of the currentquarter of seven licensees of Sealy Inc, as well as 82 pct ofthe outstanding capital stock of Sealy.    Because of these acquisitions, it said, first quarter saleswill be substantially higher than last year's 67.1 mln dlrs.    Noting that it typically reports first quarter results inlate march, said the report is likely to be issued in earlyApril this year.    It said the delay is due to administrative considerations,including conducting appraisals, in connection with theacquisitions. Reuter&#3;
