Showers continued throughout the week inthe Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since earlyJanuary and improving prospects for the coming temporao,although normal humidity levels have not been restored,Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review.    The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.    Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bagsof 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seemsthat cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in thearrivals figures.    Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to howmuch old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting haspractically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimatesaround 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln thereare a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,middlemen, exporters and processors.    There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fitfor export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties inobtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.    In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers havesold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.    Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.    Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment andonly limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.
