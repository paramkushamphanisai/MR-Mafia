"Argentina does not discard the use of (a moratorium) if thenegotiations do not produce a result that guarantees the growthof the country," he added.    Baglini, an observer at Argentina's negotiations in NewYork with the steering committee for its 320 creditors banks,told the Radio del Plata in a telephone interview that thebanks were divided on the loan request.    Baglini said that as a result, today's scheduled second dayof talks had been postponed.    He said Argentina was prepared to follow the example ofBrazil, which last week declared a moratorium on interestpayments of a large portion of its 108 billion dlr foreigndebt.    Argentina's prime objective in renegotiating the debt wasto maintain growth, which has been targeted at four pct in1987, Baglini said.
