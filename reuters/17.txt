Dean Foods Co expects earnings for thefourth quarter ending May 30 to exceed those of the sameyear-ago period, Chairman Kenneth Douglas told analysts.    In the fiscal 1986 fourth quarter the food processorreported earnings of 40 cts a share.    Douglas also said the year's sales should exceed 1.4billion dlrs, up from 1.27 billion dlrs the prior year.    He repeated an earlier projection that third-quarterearnings "will probably be off slightly" from last year's 40cts a share, falling in the range of 34 cts to 36 cts a share.    Douglas said it was too early to project whether theanticipated fourth quarter performance would be "enough for usto exceed the prior year's overall earnings" of 1.53 dlrs ashare.    In 1988, Douglas said Dean should experience "a 20 pctimprovement in our bottom line from effects of the tax reformact alone."    President Howard Dean said in fiscal 1988 the company willderive  benefits of various dairy and frozen vegetableacquisitions from Ryan Milk to the Larsen Co.    Dean also said the company will benefit from itsacquisition in late December of Elgin Blenders Inc, WestChicago.    He said the company is a major shareholder of E.B.I. FoodsLtd, a United Kingdom blender, and has licensing arrangementsin Australia, Canada, Brazil and Japan.    "It provides ann entry to McDonalds Corp &lt;MCD> we've beenafter for years," Douglas told analysts. Reuter&#3;
